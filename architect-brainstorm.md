# Architect & Brainstorm

## Overview
Collaboratively develop ideas into fully-formed designs, specifications, and implementation plans through structured dialogue.

## Process
1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Analyze current project state
   - Ask clarifying questions one at a time
   - Use multiple choice format when possible
   - Focus on understanding requirements and constraints
   
2. **Design Phase**
   - Present design in digestible sections (200-300 words each)
   - Pause after each section for feedback
   - Iterate based on your input
   - Ensure alignment before moving forward

3. **Specification Phase**
   - Document technical decisions
   - Define scope and boundaries
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Establish success criteria

## Key Constraints
- **No code writing during brainstorming** - Focus stays on design
- **200-300 word limit per response** - Prevents overwhelming walls of text
- **One question at a time** - Forces engagement and clarity
- **Iterative feedback loops** - Ensures understanding before proceeding

## Outcome
A comprehensive design document and implementation plan ready for execution, created through collaborative refinement.
