### Review local uncommitted changes

The command will review current local changes that are not yet committed. For each logical change, it will briefly explain what it is, and what's the potential risk (low/med/high).

Additionally, for every logical change, rate its impact in low/med/high, and sort the changes from low risk to high risk.
